        <p>This project, titled Detection of Systemic Diseases through Ocular Images, aims to develop a machine learning model capable of diagnosing systemic diseases using fundus images. These images of the retina provide non-invasive and cost-effective diagnostic opportunities, particularly valuable in underserved and rural regions where access to specialized medical facilities is limited. Our research focuses on detecting systemic conditions, including anemia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), cardiovascular diseases, diabetic retinopathy, and hypertension, through AI-driven analysis of ocular biomarkers.
            Retinal imaging has demonstrated potential as a diagnostic tool for systemic diseases due to the unique relationship between the eye’s vascular and neural structures and overall systemic health. Studies have shown that anomalies in the retina and optic disc can indicate underlying health conditions. By leveraging convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures such as EfficientNet and Inception, we aim to achieve high accuracy in disease detection. These models provide an efficient balance between computational performance and diagnostic precision.
            Anemia, characterized by low hemoglobin levels, manifests in retinal fundus images as hemorrhages—distinct red spots indicative of compromised blood cell health. Our model detects these hemorrhages and estimates hemoglobin concentration, offering a viable alternative to traditional blood tests. For autism spectrum disorder, morphological changes in the optic disc, including increased disc diameter and retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, serve as key biomarkers. Identifying these structural deviations in fundus images can facilitate early diagnosis and intervention.
            Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are often reflected in hypertensive retinopathy, characterized by flame-shaped hemorrhages, arteriole narrowing, lipid exudates, and optic disc swelling. These pathological changes, detectable through fundus imaging, can signal chronic high blood pressure and associated cardiovascular risks. Similarly, diabetic retinopathy—a common complication of diabetes—presents through microaneurysms, hard exudates, macular edema, and neovascularization. Early detection of these features can significantly mitigate the risk of vision loss and support diabetes management.
            Our dataset comprises 32 GB of fundus images, which are being systematically annotated to train and validate our AI models. Fundus imaging offers a comprehensive view of the retina, optic disc, and macula, enabling the detection of various systemic and ocular diseases. EfficientNet’s scalable architecture allows uniform adjustment of model depth, width, and resolution, optimizing accuracy and computational efficiency. Inception, with its multi-scale feature extraction, ensures robust performance in identifying subtle retinal anomalies.
            While fundus images suffice for diagnosing most of the targeted conditions, liver-related diseases may necessitate complementary imaging techniques, such as slit-lamp examinations, to analyze the conjunctiva, sclera, and iris. Future research may incorporate these modalities to expand diagnostic capabilities.
            This project addresses a critical healthcare gap by providing an accessible diagnostic tool for rural and underserved communities. Traditional diagnostic methods often require costly and sophisticated equipment, unavailable in remote areas like Kothri. Patients must frequently travel to urban centers, incurring delays, expenses, and missed opportunities for timely treatment. Our AI-based approach offers a portable, repeatable, and cost-efficient solution, reducing these barriers and improving early disease detection.
            The potential impact of our model extends beyond diagnosis. By facilitating early intervention for systemic diseases, we aim to reduce the incidence of severe health complications, such as heart disease, stroke, and vision loss. Our future goals include optimizing model performance through advanced training techniques, developing a mobile application for real-time analysis, and partnering with healthcare providers to implement our solution in clinical settings. This initiative not only enhances diagnostic accessibility but also leverages AI to drive social and public health improvements.
            In conclusion, the Detection of Systemic Diseases through Ocular Images project leverages cutting-edge AI technology and retinal imaging to revolutionize systemic disease diagnosis. By addressing the challenges of healthcare accessibility and diagnostic efficiency, our work has the potential to deliver significant advancements in public health, particularly for marginalized and underserved populations.
